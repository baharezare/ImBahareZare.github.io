    <h1>Project 1: Viral Infection Detection with CT-Scan Images</h1>
    <p>This project uses convolutional neural networks to detect viral infections in CT-Scan images. The goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy by leveraging deep learning techniques.
    We employ two main approaches to analyze the COVID-CT-MD dataset:

Slice-Level Neural Network Labeling: This approach labels individual CT slices using neural networks to classify them based on COVID-19 markers.

3D Image Reconstruction and Patient Data Integration: This approach combines 3D CT image reconstruction with patients' clinical data. By labeling and resampling the data, we classify each full CT scan as either normal, COVID-19, or CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia). The data is cleaned and re-sampled to account for differences in the number of slices per patient due to variations in patient size.

After pre-processing, CT slices are converted from DICOM to JPG format to facilitate the application of different deep learning techniques. Finally, we aim to build and refine models such as VGG and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve improved classification results. </p>
