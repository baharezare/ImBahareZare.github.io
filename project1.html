            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect viral infections in CT-Scan images. By analyzing medical image data, the model aims to improve the speed and accuracy of infection detection.</p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhance diagnostic capabilities with machine learning</li>
                <li>Improve detection accuracy for viral infections in CT scans</li>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Using a COVID-CT-MD dataset, we trained a CNN model on CT scan slices that were converted from DICOM to JPG format. The images were pre-processed and labeled to identify signs of infection, and the final model is built using advanced architectures such as VGG and other convolutional networks.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The model achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting infections, which has potential applications in clinical settings. Further optimization is planned to improve real-time application in hospital environments.</p>
