            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on predicting sonic log values in drilling data to enhance subsurface understanding. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model aims to assist geoscientists in optimizing drilling strategies through accurate log predictions.
            Also the paper "LEVERAGING DRILLING DATA FOR SONIC LOG PREDICTIONS USING MACHINE LEARNING
ALGORITHMS" is submitted on Journal of Petroleum and Science Engineering and is under review. </p>
