            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <p>After data analysis, we found the following correlations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Income</strong> positively correlates with the number and amount of purchases, suggesting high-income customers buy more frequently and spend more.</li>
                <li><strong>Amount Spent on Wines</strong> and <strong>Meat Products</strong> correlates highly with catalog purchases, indicating these products are primarily purchased via catalog.</li>
                <li><strong>NumWebVisitsMonth</strong> has little correlation with web purchases, but a mild correlation with deal purchases, showing deals attract customers to the website.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Preparation and Analysis</h2>
            <p>Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values and outliers. A detailed examination revealed missing data in one attribute and artificially created missing values in two others, up to 10%. All missing values and outliers were removed in the data-cleaning process. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were conducted, followed by exploratory plots to visualize distributions and patterns.</p>
